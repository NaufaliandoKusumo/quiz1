			<p>My beautiful hometown, Balikpapan, is a seaport city in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Located on the east coast of the island of Borneo (Kalimantan), 
				the city is the financial center of Kalimantan and the main gateway to the new capital of Indonesia. Balikpapan is the city with the largest economy in Kalimantan. 
				The city has both the busiest airport and seaport in Kalimantan, namely Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Sepinggan Airport and Port of Semayang. 
				With a population of 688,318 as at the 2020 Census, Balikpapan is the second most populous city in East Kalimantan, after Samarinda. 
				Balikpapan has been consistently ranked as one of the most liveable cities in Indonesia.
			<br><br>
			Balikpapan serves as headquarters for international oil companies, mining companies and related support industries operating in (and out of) eastern Kalimantan. 
			The city is a relatively clean, small city, with clear blue skies but not much by way of nightlife. The population are a mix, with lots of Javanese due to transmigration, 
			lots of people from Sulawesi, and of course, the locals. The people are quiet and polite, and the pace is slow and relaxed.</p>

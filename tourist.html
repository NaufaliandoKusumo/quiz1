			<p>Melawai Beach has become an icon or hangout place for young people living in Balikpapan and tourism on the Indonesian island of Borneo. 
				This place has become famous because of its easy-to-reach location and the typical view of the city of Balikpapan which is displayed every day as if this beach is a reflection of the city of Balikpapan itself.</p><br>
			<p>The location of Melawai beach which is in a small bay, and the view is not limited to anything, so the sunset can be seen perfectly and is beautiful from this place.
				In addition to sunset, around this there is a small island called Tukung Island or Pig Island because there are many sea urchins (in Indonesia is Bulu Babi) on this island. 
				If the water is receding we can reach this island by just walking because it is not far away.<br><br></p>
			<p>At night tourists will be presented with beautiful twinkling lights of the ship that dance beautifully on the waves of the sea. The atmosphere and scenery is what becomes a magnet for Balikpapan residents to come to Melawai Beach and spend the night.
				The night atmosphere at Melawai Beach is even more complete with the presence of cafes selling a variety of snacks to a full dinner menu.</p>
